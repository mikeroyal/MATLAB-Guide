[PRMLT](http://prml.github.io/) is Matlab code for machine learning algorithms in the PRML book.

## Tools

[MATLAB Online](https://matlab.mathworks.com) allows to users to uilitize MATLAB and Simulink through a web browser such as Google Chrome.

[Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html) is a block diagram environment for Model-Based Design. It supports simulation, automatic code generation, and continuous testing of embedded systems.

[MATLAB Schemer](https://github.com/scottclowe/matlab-schemer) is a MATLAB package makes it easy to change the color scheme (theme) of the MATLAB display and GUI.

[LRSLibrary](https://github.com/andrewssobral/lrslibrary) is a Low-Rank and Sparse Tools for Background Modeling and Subtraction in Videos. The library was designed for moving object detection in videos, but it can be also used for other computer vision and machine learning problems.

[Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/robotics.html) provides a toolbox that brings robotics specific functionality(designing, simulating, and testing manipulators, mobile robots, and humanoid robots) to MATLAB, exploiting the native capabilities of MATLAB (linear algebra, portability, graphics). The toolbox also supports mobile robots with functions for robot motion models (bicycle), path planning algorithms (bug, distance transform, D*, PRM), kinodynamic planning (lattice, RRT), localization (EKF, particle filter), map building (EKF) and simultaneous localization and mapping (EKF), and a Simulink model a of non-holonomic vehicle. The Toolbox also including a detailed Simulink model for a quadrotor flying robot.

[SEA-MAT](https://sea-mat.github.io/sea-mat/) is a collaborative effort to organize and distribute Matlab tools for the Oceanographic Community.

[Gramm](https://github.com/piermorel/gramm) is a complete data visualization toolbox for Matlab. It provides an easy to use and high-level interface to produce publication-quality plots of complex data with varied statistical visualizations. Gramm is inspired by R's ggplot2 library.

[hctsa](https://hctsa-users.gitbook.io/hctsa-manual) is a software package for running highly comparative time-series analysis using Matlab. 

[Plotly](https://plot.ly/matlab/) is a Graphing Library for MATLAB.

[YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/) is a MATLAB toolbox for optimization modeling.

[GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the numerical solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing other numerical experiments. It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation.
